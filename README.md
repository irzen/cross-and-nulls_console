# cross-and-nulls_console
Game "noughts and crosses" with field larger than 3x3.

Aim: Obtain an experience coding different states of the game (menu, gameloop) and sockets.

Current state: Not ready.
You can play solo against AI that randomly puts noughts on the field (and unable to win).

What is planned:
Network game with other player (my wife), and that means
  - more complex menu with settings (ip, players names, probably field size)
  - more complex gameloop
